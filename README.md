# CalEvent2DocMinutes
For every google calendar event with '@meeting' in it, the script creates a google doc minutes file from an existing template.

## Usage
* Copy and paste the script file in the drive folder.
* Set it to run automatically every 10-15 mins
* Create a folder named "MeetingMinutes" in the root folder of the drive
* Create a file name "Template" in this folder that will be replicated
* If the script has been given persmissions and is running, then everytime an event is created in the *default google calendar* with the phrase "@Meeting" in it - the template file is copied and given a unique file name corresponding to the event

##ToDo
* Include file as event attachment
